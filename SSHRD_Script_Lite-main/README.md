$ './sshrd_lite.sh' -p 'iphone8,2' -s '15'

# make ramdisk for product type 'iphone8,2' with exact ios version.
$ './sshrd_lite.sh' -p 'iphone8,2' -s '15.7.9'

$ './sshrd_lite.sh' -p 'iphone8,2' -b '19H384'


### Extra options ###

# decrypt iboot files with gaster useful in case firmware keys not available yet.
$ './sshrd_lite.sh' -p 'iphone8,2' -b '19H384' -g

# repack only ramdisk.img image using img4tool
$ './sshrd_lite.sh' -p 'iphone8,2' -b '19H384' -z 2

# force patch iboot files using kairos
$ './sshrd_lite.sh' -p 'iphone8,2' -b '19H384' -y 1 # (if not used script will auto select best for you)

# force patch iboot files using iBoot64Patcher # (if not used script will auto select best for you)

## Important Notes

* Do not run 'mount_filesystems' if you are running on iOS 11.x and lower.

* On Linux, usbmuxd will have to be restarted. On most distros, it's as simple as these 2 commands in another terminal:

```
$ sudo systemctl stop usbmuxd
$ sudo usbmuxd -p -f
```
